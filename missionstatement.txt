We aim to be Earth’s most customer centric company. Our mission is to continually raise the bar of the customer experience by using the internet and technology to help consumers find, discover and buy anything, and empower businesses and content creators to maximise their success.

We believe this mission is important for the UK because digital empowerment for customers and businesses improves living standards for people up and down the country and drives our economic competitiveness and productivity in a global economy.

We will continue to push at the boundaries of how technology – digital infrastructure and services – can improve the customer experience and help make the economies of the countries where we operate more competitive on the global stage.

We want to be the best in retail all over the world.
